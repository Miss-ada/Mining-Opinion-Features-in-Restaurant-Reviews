I left Table 17 feeling very ambivalent.
Some things good somethings not so great but on the whole in between.
"The room is simple, farmhouse chic: long harvest table, ornamental roosters and wooden chairs with cushions for seating."
Sundays and Mondays they have a decent prix fix menu on offer or you can order a la carte from their shared plates menu.
Spinach salad came nicely dressed though the dressing was plain could have used more tartness.
My accompaniment of frites (which were wonderful btw) on the other hand was too liberally salted with kosher salt so I guess I got the best of both worlds!
"Dessert was chilled rhubarb with creme anglaise really lovely but too much sugar in the sauce and the sprig of thyme thrown in kinda messed with my tastebuds, I really should have plucked it out!"
"My server was a lovely affable gentlemen who was very friendly, warm and quick on his toes."
I did like the service.
But the food was so-so and I find that there are better bistro options around town.
"for the time being, for all its worth, i am going to stick to the magical number three."
"not the best, but so be it; its one pm at a relatively new restaurant and i was prepared to deal."
"the waitress seemed to be the only one serving (i would guess) the 17 tables that were almost filled at that time, and so, i can appreciate it was a hard go, but at the same time it doesnt excuse for me her terseness and impatience."
"every person at a job has stress to deal with and if yours deals directly with customers, you should learn to keep the dealing with that pressure to yourself."
not exorbitant and not cheap.
"though im sure the quality of the ingredients used was high, the sandwiches felt like they could be made at home."
"in conjunction with that sentiment i am eager to admit that it takes skill to know when to stop cooking something, to pair spices up with core ingredients to arrive at something special, and not any joe will have the wherewithal to claim he can do the same whether he thinks so or not."
"but if you are going to charge me somewhere around 9 bucks for a sandwich (with no other sides except for a couple pieces of cauliflower and a sliced carrot - which were good, doused in some kind of vinegar or pickled sauce) then perhaps you should use dijon instead of yellow mustard, or applewood smoked cheddar instead of havarti."
that being said the sandwiches tasted great.
"(one thing has nothing to do with the other should you be saying to yourself something along the lines of ""well then what the hell is he complaining about"")."
"i dont need to have my dishes overpowered by their listed ingredients, but if something says its going to be flavoured by mint, fine herbs and lemon dont you think you should be able to experience that as you taste it?"
"again, to reiterate, i didnt mind the natural taste of the vegetable offered, but if thats the way it will end up tasting, perhaps you should say so."
"all my peeves aside, i am still interested in trying this place out for dinner; the feel of the place is great, cool and relaxing and as i looked at their dinner menu it looked quite tasty."
so perhaps once they get their groove on itll be more enjoyable.
Love this place.
I went there with me boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and I am glad my colleagues suggested me this place.
The food is really really good.
They have a great cocktail list.
We shared the hot balls (delicious) and the rillettes (I loved it).
"To finish, I had the lemon pannacotta...this is by far one of the best dessert I've tried."
Our waiter was really nice  and even tried to speak in French as he noticed that we were speaking French.
I will definitely go back there...I am sad this place is kind of far from were I live!
Had a lovely evening last night at Table 17.
"Great selection of wine and the owner made an excellent suggestion of something we had never heard of before - bearing in mind both price point, meal choices and preferences (though overall it was a bit of a pricey list, only one bottle south of $50, just)."
"Lovely, vibrant atmosphere, the polenta was delicious as a starter (the chef tops it with a different finish every day - last night it was meatballs) - though the other ones we saw at other tables also looked sumptuous - and our meals/sides were excellent."
"Also, the food prices

All in all a great evening  - could have happily ordered anything from the menu, and what we did order was delish."
Definitely will go back to work our way through the rest of the menu.
"Dinner: have been numerous times have tried their salumi & cheese board ($15) with was good, not Black Hoof excellent, but still pretty good."
Have also had lamb here but it must have been a special because it does not appear on the menu.
"My favourite brunch item on the menu has to be Farmer's breakfast with consists of a scotch egg (soft boiled, battered then deep fried egg), a terrine with toast and a small side salad."
Surprisingly it doesn't look like its on the menu anymore :( Have also had the stewed eggs which was also good.
It was a really fantastic experience!
"We ordered a bunch of appetizers and 3 mains, as well as dessert and cocktails......thought for sure we would get something that we did not like, but alas everything was delicious."
"To quote an obnoxiously catchy song from The Lego Movie, ""Everything is awesome...."""
"Chef John prepared an incredible fois gras app, the squid ceviche did not disappoint... the Rainbow trout was melt in your mouth delicious and we ended our foodgasm with the dark chocolate tort."
"French toast with creme anglais, pastry shell with onions, pears etc... all fabulous."
"It's a delight for the senses, this place."
Always great food and service - and a cool and inspired cocktail list.
"We had 14 guests, the room was perfect."
"Lots of food for every one, lots to choose from, and so amazingly delicious."
"It was amazing, so decadent."
It was a fantastic dinner at the end of a fantastic day.
I don't think I could have picked a better place to host my wedding meal.
"I wasn't super impressed but I also wasn't really turned off, I guess my experience was mediocre with a little disappointment."
"I found myself here ordering the much touted ""Hot Balls"" but found it just okay."
The only hot ball that really stood out was the Goat Cheese with a honey like dipping sauce.
It was actually a pretty amazing piece of creation.
"The other appetizer we have were the ""Diver Scallops"" which were cooked to perfection and came with a side of really thick and salty bacon."
"Our mains were the ""Leg of Lamb"" and ""Wild Stripped Bass"" both were great entrees that did not disappoint but at the same time didn't have a great WOW factor."
"Desert was a bit of a disappointment, not much of a variety, you had a choice between chocolate, chocolate, or chocolate in some form or another."
Overall the food experience was just okay with some ups and downs.
"But the real down of the night was the service, after sitting down to our table , it took literally 10 min for someone to show up to greet us and take our drink orders."
"The other downside of the service, they don't place the wine bottles at your table but at a communal table in the centre of the room, they're suppose to pour for you but I found that our server kept forgetting even when our wine glasses were empty."
I hope this was just an isolated experience for us as I think this restaurant is a real gem in the Leslieville area.
"If you do decide to go, make sure you have reservations as the restaurant seems to get filled up in all hours of the night."
I had a nice time at Table 17.
Table 17 had a great vibe to it.
While I prefer to have my bread toasted I understand it's not the french way (and they would have accommodated if I asked!)
"The potato rosti was totally worth breaking the diet for, and comes in 4 pieces and is easily shared!"
"The americano was outstanding they use amazing beans, and I wanted more."
"The staff are all super lovely, and the ingredients were all do fresh (you can tell these things)
A perfect brunch spot, no need to wait in line at the other two ""brunch hot spots"" in the area."
Highly recommend this spot!
Our waiter recommended me the Trout and it was amazing.
waitress Helen received us very warmly and sat us at the best table for two by the window in the sun with view onto queen st east.
"My girlfriend had the french toast, cinnamon creme anglaise and berries which she thought was pretty good."
"Helen accommodated us with it anyway:
*Paillot de chevre
*Mapledale 5 year cheddar
*Ciel de charlevoix
*Monforte toscano pecorino
*Clandestin 
Great little figs stuffed with walnuts dry crannies and almonds
A good bottle of sancerre and ""Voila""
$118 for the both of us
will come back, loved it!"
"I was very excited to try Table 17, and unfortunately it was a huge let down."
I was made to feel very uncomfortable from the moment that I walked in.
The beef tartar was by far my best course.
The tagliatelle was al dente and did not disappoint.
"The place is simple but beautiful - gorgeous reclaimed wood, candlelit tables and lush fabrics."
It just feels good when you walk in.
"The staff on both visits were very friendly and attentive, and both times the meals were excellent."
"Their prix fixe meal is tremendous value for the quality of the food you get although just a heads up that some of the dishes are very rich, so go easy on the apps!"
(re: get yourself a nice salad if you order the short ribs or risotto).
If you're feeling like a cocktail to start the meal (and who wouldn't?)
"I'm going to ignore the fact that the service was off and just chock that up to the fact that it was the poor girl's first week, so the cocktail spilled, the flatware dropped and the general feeling that the girl was nervous as all get out didn't really taint my evening because the food was excellent."
"Our group started off with the polenta special, a strong recommendation from the friends that suggested Table 17."
"As I understand it, the polenta to start rotates nightly... maybe weekly?"
"Fish, filet, sides I don't think you can go wrong, and I highly suggest grabbing things everyone will like because you'll want to start forking at your neighbor's!"
"I was impressed this place had such a strong cocktail program, figured wine was where it's at, at a place like this."
I love this place.
Love the dÌ©cor.
"The ""hot balls"" were highly recommended by a friend so we just had to order them."
I can't say I've ever had anything like them before.
"A little expensive for the size of these things, but delicious."
"I've recommended this restaurant to others, and they've loved it too."
"Considering the amount of rave reviews on here, I suggested our group of five celebrate a birthday at Table 17."
Maybe it was an off night but I walked away with a bad first impression.
"The dinner reservation was at 5:45 on a Saturday, so it wasn't like it was packed."
"We all cleaned our plates because we were starving (almost 2 hours to receive mains), but they just weren't great."
The Halibut was the best of the bunch.
Had the marinated olives and Diver Scallops to start...wow!
"The scallops were fantastic, some of the best I have had here in Toronto."
Love the square plates.
"My friend had the braised short ribs, but was mildly disappointed."
"Good size hunks of Ontario Swiss, Ontario 10 year cheddar, a blue (im not a blue fan, so didnt pay attention), a something else that was kinda gouda-esque, and wonderful creamy goat cheese."
"All in all, i thought it was quite good, but rare occurrence in Toronto where i had a fantastic meal, but my dinner date's was ho-hum."
"The service we had was fine, gentleman with a bit of a british accent was quite good and knowledgeable."
"Too bad others had issues, thought our guy was fine."
"Reservations are definitely recommended, was quite busy."
"It's nice enough for a romantic dinner (NB: Sunday and Monday nights they have a $32 three-course table d'hote, and bring your own wine) but relaxed enough for families with young kids."
"We shared an order of rosti, which was just right -- crisp and hearty."
Pretty reasonable for a nice place and great food.
Service was friendly and attentive.
I'll be frank: the only way we could afford this place was due to a gift certificate from a generous wedding guest.
"Service was great, food was fantastic, and as a nice surprise we didn't have to wait all that long for a table."
"And a good brunch can't just rely on its food for good reviews, so the answer is yes, the Ceasars were awesome."
We don't really live in the area but our visit here was really good so we'll be back.
The decor is nice and the tables are well spaced out.
They have huge windows which are nice but get in your eyes in the day so we asked the servers to bring down the shades.
"The brunch menu is pretty diverse and goes beyond the typical french toast, pancakes, scrambled eggs  with sausage/bacon/ham & hash browns deal."
"The bolognese sauce was really meaty and thick - delicious and paired with fried eggs, you just can't go wrong."
I would have preferred if I had at least toasted bread on the side for a crunch or simply just a different texture (the salad wasn't enough).
"My sisters had the Pain Dore, which is french toast with cinnamon creme anglaise & berries."
They liked it and thought the creme anglaise was a nice alternative to maple syrup.
Had a very lovely meal here on Saturday.
"The crowd was definitely older, I don't think I saw anyone under 30 in there."
"They were so delicious, I wished we had gotten the double portion after we were finished."
Polenta w/ Sausage Sugo: My affection for polenta knows no bounds so I loved every little spoonful of this.
Polenta was creamy and had a nice umami flavour.
Good liquid-to-polenta ratio made this comforting and incredibly addictive.
Will I be back?
None of the dishes even remotely disappointed me and the service was solid.
The steak frites are the best in the city.
"Took my vegetarian children for dinner, and we had an absolutely outstanding experience."
"Everything from the friendly and funny staff, to the custom vegetarian dinner that the teens devoured, was spectacular."
"The highlights: Hot balls, Brussel Sprouts, Diver scallops, Tartare, and the pasta was so light and tender with incredible delicate flavors
Kudos."
Nothing felt overwhelming.
"However, what made me fall in love with this place is thee amazing home made olive oil."
"Unfortunately, in multiple occasions I've asked if I could purchase a bottle and to my disappointment they do not sell their olive oil."
"Overall, I definitely recommend this place."
Especially their duck confit which is amazing!
PS they take reservations and it gets pretty busy so be sure to make them.
"Though the category on Yelp is listed as French, I would say the food is much closer to Italian if you had to pick a cuisine."
Benefit of the doubt moment: it was after 8 pm on a Sunday -- which in Toronto means you're lucky if anything half-decent is open at all -- and the place seemed  understaffed.
"Our waiter was friendly and self-effacing, calling us his ""little neglected table."""
"took nearly 10 minutes, and later he left us with dessert menus for 20 minutes before coming back to see what we wanted, our appetites for anything sweet having seriously waned."
"Food-wise though, things were great."
"It was heart-warming, subtle and delicious, as well as a generous portion for two to share."
Wines were great as well.
"In addition to the service problems, my one other issue was the post-prandial whiskey, a single malt ($13) that came in a far-too large glass (we were informed the kitchen was ""out"" of snifters...) and which I found harsh and not to my liking."
"I would happily give this place another shot, hopefully on day where service was at full steam."
Until then I can't give it more than three stars out of five.
A lovely experience overall.
All the food was great.
You could tell it had been prepared with great care and came out piping hot.
"The server was extremely helpful in selecting a wine, and providing recommendations on the menu."
"THE BOTTOM LINE: wonderful food, and equally as wonderful service."
"He made excellent suggestions, was very helpful, knew all the dishes, and the ingredients."
"My wife had never had venison, so it took a little convincing, but she loved it."
It was probably the best venison I've ever tasted.
"The wine was very good, and dessert was excellent, Maple Panna Cotta and Sticky Toffee Pudding."
All in all an excellent dining experience.
This hidden gem is wonderfully delicious.
Everything is great.
"Great service, great food, great environment."
Can't complain about a thing here.
Worth a try If you're in the area.
"My main was the leg of lamb, it was a little well done for my liking, but the flavour was quite nice - the morel mushrooms were loaded with a burst of buttery flavour."
"My bf started with scallops, they were quite large for scallops, and quite nice, and had a white fish, not trout, maybe halibut, that was also quite delish."
"I love the decor, and upon reading other reviews am super sad that I missed out on a group on!"
"It was wonderful anyway, and I think a great place to dine."
"We went for an early seating (a bit before 6), and I'm happy to report, that next time, I'll either go for another early seating or something later (after 9 in the evening), as it can get quite loud, and that makes it hard to hear your dining companion!"
"My hubby doesn't get super full off of the stuff, but I'm good with the amount."
I had a very good egg omelette with guacamole and my wife had the French toast.
Very nice intimate setting and the menu has very nice choices.
My son was still quite happy regardless.
We will definitely be back to claim our check in deal but that is not what would bring us back.
The exciting dinner menu is why we will be back soon.
We had a great time.
Order it and thank me later.
"Servers were hilarious, attentive, and accommodating."
I just can't see anything wrong with this place.
"I left Table 17 as pleased as could be last weekend- indulging in the very reasonably priced Sunday night table d'hÌ«te we enjoyed the scallops, salted cod, polenta, boar sausage, panna cotta and gingerbread cookies with eggnog (!)"
We were particularly wowed by the boar but the entire meal was fabulous.
A couple other reviewers noted a lack of attentiveness on the part of the servers- I would contend that our experience was the complete opposite of this.
"The server was charming, present and exceedingly helpful."
Maybe this can be racked up to visiting on an early December Sunday evening?
"In any case, it was exactly what I was hoping for and more."
I wish I could share Avitania B.
's Groupon enthusiasm because I found this place a big let down.
I too had a $50 Groupon here and was really excited to give it a try.
"At first I was concerned that this place may be too fancy and romantic for a casual dinner with a friend, but the other patrons made that problem go away fast!"
I hate it when my maid doesn't iron the cuff on my pants... blah blah blah.
I honestly wanted to tell them to all shut up.
This is by no means the restaurant's fault but killed the ambiance for sure.
I also found the menu selection to be minimal with only 6 entrees to choose from including a super tasty but super small bowl of pasta with wild mushrooms for $18.
I found the service friendly but very slow and inattentive.
At times I felt as though I might need a bell to get the waiter's attention.
"I love that they aren't over-priced (not cheap either, mind you) and that they can usually manage to squeeze you in at the end of the service without a reservation (I'm a late eater.)"
"Had dinner here once and it was ok, but the brunch was great."
Is the food at Table 17 excellent?
Is that enough for me to give it five stars?
"On both occasions my meals were delicious, fresh and expertly prepared and presented."
"The portion sizes at Table 17 are just too small, even for the average appetite."
"Add in frankly exorbitant costs, and it becomes clear that this place just ... well, just could be so much better."
My French toast for brunch was served with about five berries -not even a salad - and must have amounted to about three slices of bread in total.
It took me about five readings of the menu to actually understand what was on offer.
"Less of the fancy culinary jargon and arbitrary French/Italian synonyms for basic food items, please."
"My chicken mushroom tagliatelle was flawless as it was - was there really any need to describe it as ""Hen of the woods (is that the new word for chicken?!)"
"Thankfully, the friendly service and general lively ambiance is spared the unnecessary pretensions of the menu."
"This restaurant could be a true five-star establishment, if only it had bigger portions and a more down-to-earth, straightforward menu, that would allow the world-class food to speak for itself."
I highly suggest going around 11:30 as you just miss the 12pm rush.
It is a stylish restaurant and the service was top notch.
The cinnamon anglaise tasted like melted ice cream.
Definitely will be back for another brunch extrodinaire!
"What an experience: from the shabby-chic decor, to the wonderful service, Table 17 was an all-around treat."
"First off the ""hot balls"" ( I know, I know), were phenomenal: arancini stuffed with risotto, another with goat cheese, and finally the crab."
"For dinner, the lamb tenderloin with a parsnip puree was cooked to perfection, a friend ordered the steak frites (delish), the beef tartare was tender and spicy and you can't really go wrong with an arugula salad, which was fresh and tasty."
"Great place for a date, for a nice celebration, or just a nice culinary experience."
Also tried my first pint of Chambly on a recommendation from the bartender.
I will be hunting this beer down in other restaurants I visit.
"Bottom line: great food, cute place, fabulous dinner."
"My dinner date and I stupidly didn't think to make a reservation at 7:15 on a Saturday night (dumb, I know)."
So I definitely recommend a reservation.
"Of course there were no tables when we arrived, but the staff were more than happy to seat us at the bar, which was thankfully empty when we arrived."
"Usually not a fan of having a nice dinner at the bar, but the barman managed to do a good job of staying out of our face, but being attentive at the same time."
The server/ bartender made sure we knew all the daily specials and even recommended a few and took our drink orders (just beer).
"He also brought us a basket of bread, though it almost wasn't necessary because our appetizer came quickly."
"My date wasn't too sure about the honey at first, but actually really liked it, was a nice flavour with the mozzarella."
"It was capellini (I think, can't quite recall)...with gorgonzola cheese, roasted hazelnuts and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few ingredients."
It was awesome - great mix of flavours and the pasta was cooked perfectly and served hot.
I was skeptical about the hazelnuts at first but they were a great compliment to the gorgonzola.
My date had the beef short ribs and said they were excellent and that the meat was falling off the bone.
Just as we were digging in our server brought a little bowl with extra root vegetables because the chef had suddenly realized my date didn't get enough.
Once he pointed it out we realized there were only like 3 mini veggie cubes in his dish so it was nice that the staff noticed before we even did.
"Only main downfall was sitting at the bar, it's not the comfiest to sit on a stool and it felt a bit crowded when other patrons were seated at the bar."
"Not sure what the total bill was in the end for the 2 drinks, appetizer and two mains, but our mains were around $20-25, some on the menu were a little pricier."
"Overall great food, good service, cute place, fairly priced (though pricier than some of the other places in the neighbourhood)."
Definitely recommend.
If you want to have a more quiet place to meet up with your spouses parents for the first time - that's the place to go on a Saturday morning.
Make sure to come early as they don't accept reservations for less than groups of 6!
Food and service was excellent.
"I highly recommend the goat cheese balls, they were fantastic!"
"The restaurant itself has a really cool decor - very minimal but rustic decor, brown paper tablecloths, quaint, romantic tables and nice, high ceilings."
And obviously its age has no affected its popularity.
It was served with a fresh tomato dip and some greens and it was absolutely delicious.
"Maybe it's because it's new, but the service was the one thing that didn't make this a 5 star occasion."
"Great decor, great food, great drinks."
Will definitly be going back!
A meal at Table 17 errs on the side of pricey and while I have had many expensive meals in my lifetime as a food blogger; this one definitely errs on the side of overrated.
"The saving grace are the pea shoots, flavored with a peanut, chili and lime vinaigrette that is stellar and full-flavored."
"To add insult to injury, the lamb was lukewarm (and the reason was in no way attributed to my occupational hazard of photographing the dish)."
The Lake Erie pickerel is equally disappointing as we begin to pick at our food by this point.
"The radish fennel & grapefruit ""salad"" which to me resembles more of a slaw is bland and lacking oomph."
Our dinner suddenly finds salvation in the Spaghetti Al Anatra; its texture loosely reminding me of ramen cooked to a perfect al dente as the duck confit does its magic at flavoring the dish.
The crispy duck skin is a little scant but we happily devour the noodles.
"As with most things, what goes up must come down and in aviation-speak our dinner had a hard landing."
The Panna-Colada was equally pedestrian as it loosely resembled those cheap complimentary desserts you'd get at the end of a Chinese dinner - all gelatin and not much else.
The message at the end of the day is - don't let the appearances at Table 17 fool you.
"While everything looks great from the outside, the experience lacks substance."
Our meal with 2 glasses of wine and 3 coffees came just shy of $300.
"Suffice it to say, this will be the last time I dine at Table 17."
"Bar tender was really helpful, friendly, and made for a great weekend afternoon drink."
"Great service, the food and drinks were a miss."
Limited menu so we went with the waiter's recommendations.
The far and away highlight of the meal.
Both were disappointing.
The recommended Malbec was spot on.
"The decor was interesting, low lighting and some strangely heavy music detracted from the atmosphere."
Everything was perfect.
Service was great.
PEI oysters with the lime-tequila sauce were great.
"waiter asked to take our coats, I paused to think if I wanted it taken and decided yes."
"I was a little offended at the comment, I'm not going to lie to you."
"I am 28 year old professional but am constantly mistaken for a teenager- I think he judged us based on my ""age"" and our voucher."
He seemed genuinely interested in our opinions on the menu and food.
"Had the beef tar tar, which could have been better."
The taste of Dijon mustard was very strong and the meat was cut up almost to mush (rather than small chunks).
Seemed like accomplished mid life adults who care a lot about $ and image.
I expected better based on the reputation and price.
"I honestly felt like we were given the ""pretty woman"" young+poor treatment."
Bc we had the voucher I didn't mind as much that we weren't taken seriously and that the food was lacking- we were underpaying for it anyway!
All in all the food is a lot better than most restaurants.
I think my dish was possibly good but not put together with has much care on a that particular night.
My mashed potatoes were absolutely fantastic.
"Deserts were good too, nice and light."
It wouldn't be worth it.
The server was wonderful.
He had a great balance of being helpful and present at times and then absent when he wasn't needed.
Great venue... worth making the trek across the yonge street tracks.
Had brunch again at Table 17 for a third time and each time it's been better and better.
I'm really shocked to read all the reviews about bad service.
I am reluctant to write a review for Table 17 only because I want it to be Leslieville's best kept secret!
"The place wasn't full like all the surrounding places so not only were we served quickly, but we were also not rushed out the door."
It made a great easy Saturday morning.
"We loved that their bread comes from Bonjour Brioche, the best bakery east of the Don!"
Great sweet and savoury flavours in an appropriate portion for brunch.
The only downside about this place is that somehow I've only just discovered it!
The interior is dark wood/brick and quite cozy.
"Realistically, we were a little under-dressed for the occasion but they welcomed us in any event."
Both were really fantastic.
"No regrets here - crispy, salty, and delicious!"
"At $4, totally worth it."
I would absolutely return and recommend.
There was a '96 Bourdeaux that just had to be drunk and so my friend and I spent a lovely Sunday evening dinner obliging.
Neither of our dishes disappointed.
Uncorking two bottles of Chateauneuf du Pape for free was simply priceless.
Nice atmosphere with good food and attentive service.
Both were cooked to perfection and in manageable portions (I often feel that mediocre fine-dining restaurants throw large portions at you to compensate for weak flavour).
"Lovely ambience, we had a nice table for 2 by the window."
I'm sure the table beside us could hear our conversation as we could hear theirs when there was a pause in ours.
The fresh oysters were amazingly delicious and fresh!
I enjoy dipping my bread in olive oil and Table 17's olive oil was no better or worse then any other nice restaurant's.
We also ordered a bottle of wine and felt their wine selection was appropriate.
Make sure you make a reservation!
The summary of 3 stars for Table 17 is that it's too expensive for it's location and quality.
"It's still pretty good, I just don't like seeing a cheque for $60 for brunch."
- Brunch has a 14oz Blanche de Chamblis with a splash of OJ for $4 which is the best value on this menu
I really do like their bacon
The bad:
"I could maybe stomach $14.95 for a complete brunch, but I hate paying 10$ for eggs then having to add on the things I feel should come with it."
"Man, this place is just too expensive."
"I know that's all I keep saying about it, but they charge too much for the food here."
This was a nice little surprise.
The Comrade bartender recommend this place so we thought we'd give it a whirl.
"There was a good feel to this two roomed restaurant, classy but not fancy."
There was a long wooden table in the middle of the 2nd room where the wait staff cut bread and got their serving supplies from which I thought was a nice touch.
"The waitress we had was extremely helpful in her recommendations, both in food and drink and cute as could be."
I will return.
I can't seem to make the half star symbol work because I'd give Table 17 three and a half stars.
I have been wanting to go there for a while so when I found myself on the eastern side of the city dealing with a late day work issue I seized the opportunity.
"I can't say all that much about the decor as we sat on the side western side of the restaurant right by the door (in all fairness, we just walked in and had no res so we knew it would be hit or miss)."
"The other side of the restaurant, from what I could see, looked lovely and it appears that they have one of those large chef's tables as well."
Would have loved the figs if maybe they had squeezed some mascarpone into them and then shoved the nuts in.
I'm such a foodie critic.
"The frites are so crispy, crunchy and tangled, just the way I love them but what the hell is up with all the salt?"
The halibut was meaty but bland as hell.
Personally I felt it could have been poached in perhaps a court bouillon with lots of fresh herbs.
"The service was great, our waiter as friendly and stayed on top of making sure our glasses were looked after."
"Still, something just felt slightly off for me and I can't quite put my finger on it."
"Perhaps it may have just been our location inside of the restaurant, I never really felt like I was in it."
"I would be willing though, in all fairness, to give Table 17 another go."
The lamb sounded wonderful as did a couple of the specials of the day.
I so gotta learn to step outside my steak obsession!
Table 17 is a truly awesome restaurant and worth a visit.
"We then returned for Sunday dinner and realized they have no corkage fees that evening, what a nice surprise."
"The decor is nice, nothing overdone, just comfortable and 'rustic chic' which fits the type of place they are and food they serve."
"Speaking of food, it's the best part."
"I don't have a high end palate, but I can say that I enjoyed every dish and felt the pricing was fair."
I had very high expectations of Table 17 as it was recommended to us by a bartender at Origin (where I had a phenomenal experience - see my review) and a good family friend (who has exquisite taste).
You will usually be disappointed.
"It felt classy rustic, if that makes sense."
I felt relaxed.
The service was superb.
Our waitress was more than a joy and spouted all the day's specials by memory and was well-versed in the few wines we were deciding between.
"She was attentive, humorous and gave great recommendations."
Make me want to lick the plate clean.
"Like the last green leaf on a tree whose leaves are changing with the Autumn air, the dolce forte wild boar polenta was the sparkling highlight in the crowd."
"Even if you don't like polenta, order it."
The presentation itself is worth it.
"I would have liked it a bit saltier, but maybe that's just me."
"We also ordered the chilled white gazpacho (definitely recommend), charcuterie board (typical), warm roasted beets side dish (yummy but I wanted more goat cheese!"
"), summer arugula salad with blue cheese and peaches (the peaches were lovely) and the steak tartare."
I am a sucker for steak tartare and always order it when it's on the menu.
"While some may like this, I did not."
"It tasted like beets, not meat."
"I know every restaurant can't be phenomenal, but at those prices, I am a bit tougher on the food and my expectations are a bit higher."
I actually had no issue with that because I often find the gamey taste of lamb and goat distasteful.
She on the other hand was slightly disappointed about the legendary hot balls from Table 17.
"EntrÌ©e:

Haddock: Haddock with chanterelle mushroom, sprouts, truffled potato, radish
Perhaps our expectations for fresh seafood is a little high."
Fresh fish tends to hold together better.
The panna cotta was silky and smooth (like my legs...just kidding!)
"In the end, I wish the chef would balance the dishes with more acids, spices and fresh herbs instead of sodium and grease."
I really wanted to fall in love with this cosy little restaurant!
"Among the cosy bistros popping up in Leslieville, Table 17 was among the first, and is among the best for its consistency in quality of food and service."
"I also really appreciate the Sunday & Monday BYOB nights, and wish other restaurants would take Table 17's lead on this generous offering."
I am always happy to see my favourite mains such as the braised beef short ribs and steak frites on the menu (and I happily order them over and over each visit - the fries appear to be crisply double fried in duck fat in traditional Belgian style.
"That said, the menu does not seem to have changed very much over the years, and I almost wish they would take that risk and do a bit of a menu refresh."
I still give it 4 stars because I go there when I crave my favourites.
"When I'm feeling adventurous, I just go a little further west on Queen to Ruby Watchco."
Taste good but bad value.
We both had a app main and desert and still very hungry.
"Very good food and great atmosphere, friendly service."
Know I here is shut down and closed that's sad :(
What a relaxed place to enjoy a nice dinner.
Tonight we got the right amount of attention without feeling rushed.
"All excellent, but the venison was truly a standout."
"I have been here a couple of times, but tonight was the best."
Certainly will return.
"The duck rillette was really delightful, and I am generally not a huge duck fan."
"I'm not sure if that was orange zest or I imagined it in there, that's how subtle the flavors can be, but  I loved it."
Especially the piquance of the pickled carrots with the toast and meat.
"The greens were perfect to me--again, very simply prepared."
The arugala salad had the perfect amount of dressing on it.
Disappointing experience.
Decor was lovely (especially the bathroom!
Table 17 is a quaint find in Leslieville village perfect for a good catch up with your girlfriends or a dinner date.
"The restaurant is divided into two rooms - the first room you walk into features a long bar and some seating and the room towards the side which we get seated in, is simple, farmhouse chic."
"It was heart-warming, a generous portion - ideal for our group of 3."
The lamb ragu was flavourful and the polenta with some grated Parmesan cheese and cracked pepper was still light as air.
Service was bad and food wasn't much better.
The main course was a huge disappointment.
My fiancÌ© ordered the trout on a recommendation from our server.
It was bland and undercooked.
The avocado mousse tasted processed and fake.
I ordered the Simcoe County Pork Chop after our server highly recommended it over the steak frites.
"Super bland, no spices."
"Maybe it was an off night as there seem to be mostly positive reviews, but we left disappointed."
"I had a groupon certificate for Table 17 and I'm not usually one to purchase groupons unless it's a place I really want to try or already like, We walked in without reservations, which I am also not prone to doing, but they had a small table available that was out of the way and quiet."
I've heard others complain about the service here.
"I found it to be fabulous, and I'm in the industry myself, so I know what the job entails."
Our server explained the specials and gave us some great recommendations for drinks and menu items.
The hot balls (arroncini) were fabulous and small enough to add on to any meal without spoiling your appetite.
Lamb leg and merguez sausage wad fabulous and surprisingly lean.
"when you use a groupon, please please please remember to tip on the amount before discount."
Your server worked just as hard as he or she would for any other patron and it's in very bad taste to not acknowledge this.
In addition it was BYOW night and no corkage fee - just some extra special icing on an already delicious cake!
"The food and service were good, but my confusion lies in the cost of the Caesar at brunch time."
I saw they have a super special one on menu for $12 but I cannot justify paying that much for a Caesar.
My bad for not reading the menu fully and noticing they are not part of the discounted brunch drinks anymore.
Everything was really delicious and unique.
I've been searching for a great French toast and this one was right up at the top.
We'll be coming back for sure!
What a great little restaurant in Leslieville.
Not too expensive and the the variety on the menu was a nice change from many other restaurants in the city.
I will definitely go back!
"The waiter made excellent suggestions for drinks, apps, and entrees."
"The ambience is nice, quiet yet trendy."
The only downside is that the entrees were very small - fortunately they weren't horribly expensive.
The drinks on the other hand.... Let's just say I'm very happy I wasn't paying ($15 for a basic martini).
"They have some fun cocktails, and the ambiance is great."
The nature of the menu (not traditional brunch obviously) precipitates only infrequent visits (I'm and eggs benny guy on Sunday mornings) but when we go we love it.
"All hail the mighty Groupon, without which I never would have experienced this place."
"After a really long, rainy, and cold school week during which my meals mainly consisted of stuff I grabbed from convenience stores on campus, I really needed a good dinner."
Table 17 hit just the right spot.
"The standout starter for me, though, was the Ribollita soup -- a white bean soup with pancetta and kale."
"They were fork tender, but slightly dry and tough on top -- maybe I got the top of the pot or something -- but still delicious and just the perfect comfort food that I needed."
"Service was great for the most part, but they were experiencing problems with their credit card machine that was a little frustrating -- they didn't seem to have a separate phone line for their credit card machine, so every time someone would call the restaurant, it would kick the credit card machine offline."
"The food was excellent and I'm definitely coming back soon (dying to try their BYOW Table D'hote on Sundays and Mondays), but next time I visit, I'm totally bringing cash."
Both times everything has been excellent and the service is great and friendly.
Recommended.
"With a groupon in my hand and the final days ticking before expiration, I knew I had to get in here for what I hoped to be a fantastic dinner."
The flavours and other components of the dish paired very well.. just wish there was more creamy goodness.
I was tempted to go with the shortribs because I knew I would not be disappointed from my first experience.
"I was grinning ear to ear... the scallops were perfectly cooked, loads of flavour in the broth, and I could not get enough."
"I'm just not a super big fan of clams, so I cannot really comment on them."
"Rich, decadent, tasty, mouth watering..... it was just like I remembered and more!"
"S had the banana cheesecake, which I was hesitant about because I'm not sure how that could go well together... but it was actually surprisingly subtle but evident in banana flavour."
"With a touch of peanut butter to finish it off, the dessert was a great choice."
I'm so glad that my second experience was just as good as the first.
"As someone who doesn't repeat restaurants often, I can vouch that this one will not disappoint."
"), Table 17 is possibly a little too beautiful for the neighbourhood, but I suppose that makes it a true diamond in rough because it's such a nice place."
Lamb was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the merguez was delicious.
A perfect plate.
The service was excellent and our water & wine was always kept topped off .
"It's a small place with only a few tables, dark hardwood, large mirrors, chandeliers and a nice long wooden table in the middle with food artfully displayed."
Definitely a great date spot.
"Apparently on Sunday/Monday you can bring-your-own-wine, but not sure what the corkage fee was."
It came with some pretty boring side vegetables but overall the meal was satisfying.
Its a little on the pricey side but our server was great and I enjoy the vibe.
"The goat cheese balls were excellent, reminding me I never get enough goat cheese in my diet or to my liking."
I would not recommend dipping them in the accompanying honey.
The sweet just masks the wild goat cheese taste.
"Actually, it would be nice if you could order 6 goat cheese hot balls straight up."
It tasted like something you might get during a summer/winterlicious.
"Being from the Lake Erie region, I like a tenderly cooked pickerel that allows you to enjoy the delicate texture and nuanced flavor of this white fish."
"But Table 17 prepares it extra crispy, burning the joy out of this fish."
Slinky woman ordered the arctic char and seemed to have no complaints.
Service is excellent.
Table 17 seems a nice addition to the aspirational bars that have cropped up in Leslieville along Queen street.
The only thing I hate about Leslieville is it seems so dark.
Quite a great meal.
Shoulder of Ontario lamb was great with a hint of mint in the salsa verde.
Nice wine list.
Will return soon.
Server was a very lively & attentive British man.
The steak frites was excellent & cooked medium-rare.
There are better options out there for the price range.
My experience with Table 17 were excellent.
I do like the French Countryside deco giving the interior a homey and farmhouse vibe.
We were greeted warmly at the door and the service was really attentive for the whole evening.
Everything was well prepared with great care.
I even enjoyed my Lamb Polenta and I am not a lamb or polenta lover!
Will definitely return when I am in the neighbourhood.
"wow this place is amazing for brunch, french style cuisine, free parking on side streets even on weekends!"
I wanted to go to Table 17 since I moved down to Leslieville and was excited to finally find an opportunity to go.
"The decor is nice but very loud, with a large table in the middle of the main dining room for the servers to cut bread which we didn't receive until about 20 minutes after we were seated."
I had their fresh oysters which were incredible tasted like they were fresh out of the ocean.
"What I loved the most here was their own homemade olive oil, simply the best olive oil I have tried I can just sit there the whole day having their freshly baked baguettes dipping in their basalmic vinegar and olive oil."
Glad my girlfriend showed me this little place book a reservation today you wont regret it!
I had the most wonderful experience at Table 17 recently.
I absolutely loved this!
"The liver spread was delightfully creamy and I loved that intense flavour of the liver, complemented by a dab of tangy Dijon mustard."
"Steak Frites - 8oz thick cut top sirloin, served with lemon mayo - was executed to perfection."
"I had the striped bass, served over sweet onion purÌ©e and tartar garnish, with beer battered sweet dumpling squash and hen of the woods mushroom."
The fish was perfectly cooked and the skin was nice and crispy.
The bacon's saltiness really brought out the sweetness of the panna cotta and also provided a great crunch.
I loved that there was a generous amount of nuts in every bite.
"I wished the pistachio could be a little more toasted and crunchier, but the tart was, nevertheless, delicious."
It was a delicious meal and a great experience altogether.
"After trying to find a table at various downtown restaurants downtown and frowned upon for expecting to ""walk-in"" on a Saturday night we happened to find parking (another surprise for a Saturday night) right in front of Table 17 as if it was meant to be."
"We walked in expecting to be turned away, especially since it was quarter past 10pm,  and were graciously seated at a pretty table by the window."
"The atmosphere was perfect - mellow but happy crowd lingering over dessert, attentive hostesses dressed casual and candlelight in a rustic contemporary decor."
The menu isn't extensive but offers a good variety to please any dietary preferences.
We ordered the soft shell crab to start and it was set on top of a green chutney which elevated the taste of the crab and was just delicious.
I had the lemon caper pasta which was really good and my DH ordered the lamb which was falling-off-the-bone goodness on a plate.
A great evening and I am glad we didn't get a table anywhere else - Table 17 rocks!
"My partner and I went to Table 17 for dinner while on a visit to Toronto, we both felt that this was a very good restaurant based on both food and service."
"The atmosphere there is rather romantic, with candlelight and a somewhat dark setting."
"Since there were two of us, we were able to try a good portion of the menu, and we were rather impressed with what we got."
Our waitresses very friendly and indulged all are crazy questions and requests.
"Overall, I would definitely recommend Table 17 for either a group dinner or romantic dinner."
